## Inspiration

There are plenty of learning resources out there that students have access to, but each resource tends to only consist of kind of functionality, thereby limiting students' learning experience. From this standpoint, our group sought to build a platform that not only is a one-stop-shop for tools that students will find useful as they navigate either their high school or college career, but one that helps them better grasp concepts as well as save a lot of time.

## What it does

The tool allows a user to first upload a PDF of any kind, whether it is a research paper, a text book, a general book, or scanned notes. The user is then able to access three primary functionalities, one being a feature that allows a user to select which file they would like to obtain a concise summary on since multiple file uploads are permitted and along with a summary, statistics about the file are also displayed such as its legibility index. The other one is a feature where the user can select a file to get questions generated for and they can also at the same time choose what kinds of questions they would like generated whether it may be multiple choice, true or false, short answer or all three. The generated questions are then by default exported as a PDF for the user to access later on. There's also a mini chatbot feature where the user can ask questions about any of their uploaded files and get a response within a matter of seconds. This serves to get better clarification on concepts the user did not understand if at all they used the text summary feature.
